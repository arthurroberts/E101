<h1>Number systems. Binary Numbers. </h1>

<h2>Positional systems.  </h2>

<p>
We are used to decimal system - we use 10 symbols to represent any number.
So if we start counting... 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9..
Now we run out of symbols to write the number (10), what we do?
When we want to represent 10 we use next digit to the left:<br>
10 = 10<sup>1</sup> + 0.<br>
It is positional system and value in second digit is count of how many 10s
there are in this number.
</p>

Contribution of the value of every digit depends on which digit it is (where it is)-
system we use is positional.
<table border="1">>
<tr>
<th>Digit</th><th> digit5</th>
<th> digit4</th>
<th> digit3</th>
<th> digit2</th>
<th> digit1</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Weight</td>
<td> 10<sup>4</sup> = 10000</td>
<td> 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000</td>
<td> 10<sup>2</sup> = 100</td>
<td> 10<sup>1</sup> = 10</td>
<td> 1 = 100</td>
</tr>
</table>
Example: Number 567 can be written as:<br>
567 = 5 * 100 + 6 * 10 + 7 *1
<br>
Not all number systems are positional. Roman, for example, is not.<br>


Question: Why we use 10 symbols?

<ul>
 <li>We have 10 fingers</li>
 <li> 10 is magic number</li>
</ul> 
In decimal we use 10 symbols for each position.
For decimal system:
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr>
 <th> digit5</th> <th>digit4</th> <th>digit3</th> <th>digit2</th> <th>digit1</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
 <td>10,0000</td> <td>1,000</td> <td>100</td> <td>10</td> <td>1</td>
</tr> 
</table>

Weight 104
 = 10000 1000 = 10
3
 100 = 102
 10 = 101
 1 = 100


Other systems are possible, decimal is not only possible option.

<h2>Binary system.</h2>
Now we start working on converting numbers into computer hardware. It
would be hard to have ten different voltages to represent ten decimal symbols.
It is hard to design digital electronic device which works with 10 different voltages.
<br> 
In binary we use 2 symbols to represent all numbers. 
Computer circuitry is required
to operate using only two voltages (and one is usually 0). Basically it works 
like a switch.<br>
And symbols are 0 (there is no voltage) and 1 (yes, voltage is there).
<br>
We use same same approach for binary numbers - how much this particular symbol
contribute to the value is based on position of this symbol.
Lets start counting...<br>
<ol>
<li>value 0 is written as 0 and no great surprises here, symbol is available.</li>
<li>value 1 is written as 1, symbol is available.</li>
<li>value 2 - we have a problem, there is no symbol available for 2. So we use
	positional approach - we write 10, on understanding that if symbol 1 is put
	into one digit to the left, it means that it contributes 2 to the total value.
	There are 10 types of people in the world - those who understand binary and those
	who don't.
</li>
</ol>

For binary system digit weights are:
<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr><th>Digit</th>
 <th>digit6</th>
 <th>digit5</th>
 <th>digit4</th>
 <th>digit3</th>
 <th>digit2</th>
 <th>digit1</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>Weight</td> <td>64 = 2<sup>6</sup></td><td> 32 = 2<sup>5</sup></td>
 <td>16 = 2<sup>4</sup></td><td>8 = 2<sup>3</sup></td> <td> 4=2<sup>2</sup></td><td> 2=2<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr> 
</table> 
<h2>Conversion from Binary system to decimal.</h2>
That is straightforward process. We take binary number, for example 1011.
We write down weights of each digit:
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr> <th>Digit</th> <th>digit4</th> <th>digit3</th> <th>digit2</th> <th>digit1</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>Weight</td> <td>8</td> <td>4</td> <td>2</td> <td>1</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>Value</td> <td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td>
</tr> 
</table>
Now we take only those weights where digit is 1 and add them up:<br>
8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11.<br>
So binary number 1011 is decimal number 11.<br><br>

<h2>Conversion from Decimal to Binary.</h2>
<h3> Intuitive way.</h3>
We have set of powers of 2: ..64,32,16,8,4,2,1,0.<br>
We want to convert decimal number to binary, say it is 45. 
<ol>
  <li> What is the biggest number taken from the set above which we can fit. It is 32. </li>
  <li> If we have 32 counted for, then binary number looks like <b> 1XXXXX</b>,
  where <b>XXXXX</b> should equal 45-32 = 13</li>
  <li> Can we fit 2^4=16 into 13? No. So binary becomes <b> 10XXXX</b> and XXXX represents 13.</li>
  <li> Can we fit 8 into 13? Yes, we can. Our number becomes <b> 101XXX</b> and <b> XXX</b>
   represents 13-8 = 5</li>
  <li> Can we fit 4 into 5? Yes, we can. Our number becomes <b> 1011XX</b> and <b> XX</b>
   represents 5-4 = 1</li>
  <li> Can we fit 2 into 1? No, we cannot. Our number becomes <b> 10110X</b> and <b> X</b>
   represents 1.</li>
  <li> Can we fit 1 into 1? Yes, we can. Our number becomes <b> 101101</b> and we are done.</li>
  </ol>

<div class="box">
    <div class="title">Question:.</div>
     Convert decimal number 7 to <b>binary</b>.
     <ol>
      <li>0111</li>
      <li>1100</li>
      <li>1001</li>
     </ol>
     <details>
  <summary>Show:</summary>
  <p> 7: 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 +1*1-> <b>0111</b></p>
</details>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <div class="title">Question:.</div>
     Convert decimal number 2 to <b>binary</b>.
     <ol>
      <li>0010</li>
      <li>0100</li>
      <li>1011</li>
     </ol>
     <details>
  <summary>Show:</summary>
  <p> 2: 0*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 +0*1 -> <b>0010</b> </p>
</details>
</div>

<h3> More formal way - repeated division.</h3>
Another way to convert decimal number into binary is to use repeated division by 2.
We take decimal number, say 45, and divide it by 2, keeping track of quotient and remainder.
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr> <th>Quotient</th> <th>Remainder</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>45 / 2 = 22</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>22 / 2 = 11</td> <td>0</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>11 / 2 = 5</td> <td>1</td> </tr>		
<tr> <td>5 / 2 = 2</td> <td>1</td> </tr>		
<tr> <td>2 / 2 = 1</td> <td>0</td> </tr>		
<tr> <td>1 / 2 = 0</td> <td>1</td> </tr>		
</table>
Now we take remainders from bottom to top and write them down - it is binary representation
of our decimal number 45 - it is 101101.	



<h2>Counting in binary.</h2>
We can count in binary as we do in decimal.
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr> <th>Decimal</th> <th>Binary</th></tr>
<tr>  <td>0</td> <td>0</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>1</td> <td>1</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>2</td> <td>10</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>3</td> <td>11</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>4</td> <td>100</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>5</td> <td>101</td></tr>
</table>
We can keep counting forever... but computers have limited memory.
<p>
  There is one thing to note here - we have finite number of digits to represent
  binary number. We can not fit infinite number of digits into computer memory.
  So if we have N bits to represent binary number, what is the biggest number
  we can represent?
</p>
  Using N bits we can write 2<sup>N</sup> -1 numbers.
For example using 3 bits we can write 2<sup>3</sup> -1 = 7 numbers (0 to 7):
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.<br>
Using 8 bits we can write 2<sup>8</sup> -1 = 255 numbers (0 to 255).<br>
Biggest number which can be written using 8 bits is 
 \[ 128 \cdot 1 + 64 \cdot 1 + 32 \cdot 1 + 16 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 1 +
  4 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 255 \].<br>

Using 16 bits we can write 2<sup>16</sup> -1 = 65535 numbers (0 to 65535).<br>

What happens if we try to write number bigger than what can be represented
using available number of bits?
It is called <b>overflow</b> and it leads to unexpected results. And it happens a lot.
</p>

Are there other positional systems used in computing?
Yes, there are. One of them is hexadecimal system.

<h2>Hexadecimal</h2>
<h3>Why hexadecimal?</h3>
Hexadecimal system is base 16 system. It uses 16 symbols to represent numbers.
Why we need it?
</p>
Binary numbers are long and hard to read. 
As an example here is C code to print memory address of a variable in binary:
<br>
<a href="Code/var_addr.c" download> <button>Download file var_addr.c .</button></a>
<br>
<!--
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <inttypes.h>   
void print_binary(uintptr_t n) {
    for (int i = sizeof(n) * 8 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        putchar((n & (1UL << i)) ? '1' : '0');
    }
} 
int main() {
    int var = 42;
    int *ptr = &var;
    uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t)ptr;
    printf("Pointer address in binary: ");
    print_binary(addr);
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
</pre>
-->  

If we run this code we get something like:
<pre>
Pointer address in binary: 0000000000000000000000000010110100101101101110000110100000000
</pre>
Not very readable: there are 64 bits (width of memory address in a 64-bit system) 
there and it is hard to figure out what is going on.
</p>
Hexadecimal numbers are more compact and easier to read.
Hexadecimal is base 16 system, so it uses 16 symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
Where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15 in decimal.
<p>
  So we start counting in hexadecimal:
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr> <th>Decimal</th> <th>Hex</th></tr>
<tr>  <td>0</td> <td>0</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>1</td> <td>1</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>2</td> <td>2</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>3</td> <td>3</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>4</td> <td>4</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>5</td> <td>5</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>6</td> <td>6</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>7</td> <td>7</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>8</td> <td>8</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>9</td> <td>9</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>10</td> <td>(oops, no more symbols)A</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>11</td> <td>B</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>12</td> <td>C</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>13</td> <td>D</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>14</td> <td>E</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>15</td> <td>F</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>16</td> <td>10</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>17</td> <td>11</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

Hexadecimal is positional system, so each digit has weight based on position.
Digit weights are:
<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr><th>Digit</th>
 <th>digit6</th>
 <th>digit5</th>
 <th>digit4</th>
 <th>digit3</th>
 <th>digit2</th>
 <th>digit1</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>Weight</td> <td>64 = 2<sup>6</sup></td><td> 16<sup>4</sup>= 65536</td>
 <td>16<sup>3</sup>=4096</td><td>16<sup>2</sup>=256</td> <td> 16<sup>1</sup>=16</td><td> 16<sup>0</sup>=1</td>
</tr> 
</table> 
As we pack more into each digit, numbers written in hexadecimal have less
digits. <br>
Hexadecimal is used a lot in computing and has special prefix 0x to indicate
that number is hexadecimal. For example 0x2F is hexadecimal number.

<h3>Conversion from hexadecimal to decimal.</h3>
That is straightforward process. We take hexadecimal number, for example 0x2F.
We write down weights of each digit:
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr> <th>Digit</th> <th>digit2</th> <th>digit1</th> </tr>
<tr> 
<td>Weight</td> <td>16</td> <td>1</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>Value</td> <td>2</td> <td>F (15)</td>
</tr> 
</table>
Now we take only those weights where digit is not 0 and add them up:<br>
2 * 16 + 15 * 1 = 32 + 15 = 47.<br>
So hexadecimal number 0x2F is decimal number 47.<br><br>
<div class="box">
    <div class="title">Question:.</div>

      <li>173</li>
     </ol>
     <details>
  <summary>Show:</summary>
  <p>163: 10*16 + 3*1</p>
</details>
</div>

<h3> Why 16? </h3>
Indeed, why 16?
<br>
Because it is power of 2 - 2<sup>4</sup> = 16. It is easy to convert
binary numbers into hexadecimal - we just group binary digits into
groups of 4 bits (from right to left) and convert each group into
hexadecimal digit.
<br>
<p>
  Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits (nibble):
  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr> <th>Binary</th> <th>Hex</th></tr>
<tr>  <td>0000</td> <td>0</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>0001</td> <td>1</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>0010</td> <td>2</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>0011</td> <td>3</td></tr> 
<tr>  <td>0100</td> <td>4</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>0101</td> <td>5</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>0110</td> <td>6</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>0111</td> <td>7</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1000</td> <td>8</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1001</td> <td>9</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1010</td> <td>A</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1011</td> <td>B</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1100</td> <td>C</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1101</td> <td>D</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1110</td> <td>E</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>1111</td> <td>F</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
  As an example take binary number   <b>  1010 1111</b>: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>We group bits into groups of 4 (nibble):
    1010 1111</li>
    <li>
    Now we convert each nibble into hexadecimal digit:
    1010    1111 -> 0x A F  
    So hexadecimal representation of this binary number is:
    AF
    </li>
    <li>>
    We want to check that it is correct:
    <br>
    A in hexadecimal is 10 in decimal, weight for this digit is 16.<br>
    F in hexadecimal is 15 in decimal, weight for this digit is 1.<br>
    So we convert hexadecimal number 0xAF into decimal:
     0xAF = 10 * 16 + 15 * 1 = 175
    <br>
    Now we convert binary number 1010 1111 into decimal:
    <br>
    1*128 + 0*64 + 1*32 + 0*16 + 1*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 1*1 = 175.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    So conversion is correct.
  </p>

As an example take binary number:
<br>
 1101101110000110100000000000
<br>
We group bits into groups of 4 (nibble):
<br>
 1101 1011 1000 0110 1000 0000 0000
<br>
Now we convert each nibble into hexadecimal digit:
<br>
0x  D    B    8    6    8    0    0
<br>
So hexadecimal representation of this binary number is:
<br>
0xDB86800
<br>
Which is much more compact and easier to read.

<h3> Using hexadecimal in computing </h3>
Hexadecimal is used a lot in computing to represent memory addresses
and other values.
<br>
For example here is the code above which prints memory address of a variable.
<br>
<a href="Code/var_addr.c" download>  <button>Download file var_addr.c .</button></a>
<br>

If we run this code we get something like:
<pre>
Pointer address in binary: 0000000000000000000000000010110100101101101110000110100000000
Pointer address in hex: 0x2f6ed60
Pointer address in decimal: 49812320
</pre>
As you can see hexadecimal representation is much more compact and easier to read.
Another usage of hexadecimal is to represent colors in web design.
We will cover that later in the course.<br>

But we should not forget that computer hardware works with binary numbers.
Hexadecimal is just more convenient way to represent binary numbers 
and make them easier to read.
