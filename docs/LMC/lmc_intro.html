<h1 >LMC branching. </h1>

<h1> What we have so far is not enough.</h1>
What we achieved so far is ability to add and subtract values 
stored in memory. That is not enough for general computation.<br/>
<h2> Turing-complete system. </h2>
There are many possible algorithms. Mathematician Alan Turing showed
that everything that can be calculated (and some things can not) can be
done by <b>Turing machine.</b>
For computational system system to be Turing-complete, following requirements
should be met:
<ol>
    <li> It should provide branching </li>
    <li> It should provide loops.</li>
    <li> Memory should be infinite.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Branching (conditional execution) in LMC</h2>
<p>
How branching can be achieved?<br/>
You can recall that algorithm is a sequence of operations and each
operation is stored in memory at certain address. Program Counter (PC, pointer to 
memory location)
keeps track of what is done.<br/>
If we want to interrupt sequential execution, simple way is to change
the value stored in PC.<br/>
</p>
<h3> Unconditional jump - BRA XX. </h3>
First and not really conditional operator is <b>BRA XX.</b>
It writes value <b>XX</b> into Program Counter.<br/>
Here is an example of unconditional jump:<br/>
<pre style="background-color: rgb(200,200,250);">
INP
STO 20
INP
STO 21
BRA 0
HLT</pre>
Programs goes around forever - we made <b>infinite loop.</b>

<h3> Jump if 0 - BRZ XX</h3>
<p>
Here is true conditional jump: value XX is written into PC if Accumulator contains 0.
Overall result is conditional jump.<br/>
Here is the example - program which count down from specified number down to 0.

<pre style="background-color: rgb(200,200,250);">
INP
STO 20
INP
STO 21
SUB 20
OUT
BRZ 8
BRA 4
HLT</pre>
</p>

<h3> Jump if 0 - BRP XX </h3>
<p>

<h2>  Some non-critical but nice improvements.</h2>
We have all critical components: memory storage, conditional execution and
cycles.<br>
